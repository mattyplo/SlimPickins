As a user
I want to save my food allergies/sensitivities so SlimPickin can warn me to avoid items with those ingredients.
I want to be able to just set my diet style (i.e. vegan/paleo/keto) and let SlimPickin generate recommend list of food for me
I want to be able to quickly look up how I was doing in the past without looking at day to day intakes
I want to be able to create new food item and its calories/nutrition facts
I want to be able to setup a list of favorites and have them recommend to me more often
I want to be able to search for food item based on what I feel like to have at the time (i.e. hot soup on a chill night)
I want to be made aware what food is in the season right now
I want to be able to put my diabetic status in my portfolio so SlimPickin can warn/recommend me on food choice
I want to be able to set and track cheat days with SlimPickin
I want to be able to compare different food items for its calories and nutrition so I can make informed choice.
