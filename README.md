The Slim Pickins web application is a simple calorie counter.  It allows a user to enter food items in and the calories consumed in order to keep a tally of total caloric consumption.  It will be presented as a blog / journal.  A user will be able to submit particular food items and the calories associated with that item.  The user can list their meals daily and keep track of their meals over a period of time.  The user will have a profile page.  The project has a backlog of user stories that the developers created to help divide the work up into logical bits.
