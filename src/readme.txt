mockup is done, please check the mockup branch for the final version.
also implemented reusable header (include nav bar) and footer feature.
also implemented user story "As a user, when I visit SlimPickins, I can see from highlighted nav bar item which section of the site I am on."
also implemented user story "As a user, when I try to login to SlimPickins, I cannot submit empty username and password.

few notes as 1/26:
the footer is one that was on the journal mock-up originally which looks kind odd. but maybe Matt and Sojung has talk this through and decided this is what we need?
Yes, I know the server side code for the project is php only, the formValidation.js is only there for mock-up demonstration purpose.
